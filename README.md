# Ideas

This repo has some crazy ideas that could become, some day, in awesome projects.

## Facebook chat cli


### Description:

There are many cli extension through npm modules, like:

* https://github.com/sindresorhus/term-img-cli
* https://github.com/chjj/blessed
* https://github.com/JoshCheek/animated-gif-in-the-terminal
* https://github.com/as-cii/terminal-emojify
* https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib

That improve the terminal experience, also there are some facebook messenger clones like [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine).

So, the idea is simple, clone the facebook chat on the terminal, so there is no need of a browser.

## Soundcloud cli (vplayer)

### Description:

Similar to facebook chat cli, but easier because there is a [public API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) for the souncloud app. Some people already made some [GUI app](https://github.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app) with it

## Github chrome extension

### Description:

There are already some github chrome extensions, but this wouls be only to (better) manage github stars, as Github only group by langague.

## Mobilify

### Description:

Heavily inspired by the awesome [nativifier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier). Basically, the same but to make mobile apps from a web page. It would use cordova to take the html, js and css and convert it in a mobile app. It would be useful for awesome pages that doesn't have a mobile app, but have awesome mobile sites, for example, Github.
