# Ideas

This repo has some crazy ideas that could become, some day, in awesome projects.

## Facebook chat cli


### Description:

There are many cli extension through npm modules, like:

* https://github.com/sindresorhus/term-img-cli
* https://github.com/chjj/blessed
* https://github.com/JoshCheek/animated-gif-in-the-terminal
* https://github.com/as-cii/terminal-emojify
* https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib

That improve the terminal experience, also there are some facebook messenger clones like [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine).

So, the idea is simple, clone the facebook chat on the terminal, so there is no need of a browser.

## Soundcloud cli (vplayer)

### Description:

Similar to facebook chat cli, but easier because there is a [public API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) for the souncloud app. Some people already made some [GUI app](https://github.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app) with it

## Github chrome extension

### Description:

There are already some github chrome extensions, but this wouls be only to (better) manage github stars, as Github only group by langague.

## Mobilify

### Description:

Heavily inspired by the awesome [nativifier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier). Basically, the same but to make mobile apps from a web page. It would use cordova to take the html, js and css and convert it in a mobile app. It would be useful for awesome pages that doesn't have a mobile app, but have awesome mobile sites, for example, Github.

## Social coding

### Description:

Github and Stackoverflow are some of the most popular dev sites/tools. They have two big things in common:

1. A public API
2. They are social!

So, it would be awesome to have some feed of your social coding, for the cli or as an embedded html (to add to portfolio for example)
