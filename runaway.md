# Runaway

> Abandona el barco, no porque se hunda, sino para que se hunda.

## description:

The main goal of this project is to leave social media networks, mainly facebook.
Big web networks, like facebook, are a trap because they are huge, so they looks 
like public networks, but they are not, they are controlled by big corporations.
So, this project is basically a way to escape social networks while keeping your 
self aware of what happens in it.

The project consist of two softwares:

## Data download

Some tool to help you get back your media from facebook.

## Ghost

A facebook bot that let you know of news and events of interest.

- events: The bot keet an iCalendar for the events shared by the people/pages 
you like, optionally it can send desktop notifications for them.
- news: Notify yourself when people/pages you like share any external link or a 
media from facebook.
