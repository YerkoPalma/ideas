# Inclusive linter

> Drop gender to the trash

## Description

Similar to what eslint does, this would check a piece of text to find 
uninclusive parts in different languages. For example, replaces all the `he` 
for `he/she`, or in spanish replace `amigos` with `amigxs` or `amig@s` allowing 
to configure the inclusive char. [Alex project](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) 
seems to do something very similar.
